# ML_heart_disease
Making a k-NN model for predicting heart disease and also briefly exploring PCA with this dataset for fun
The project is not yet finished as I would like to create more visuals and organize and add more comments to make the code more readable


I successfully classified 2 patient profiles (1 normal, 1 abnormal) based on the ref. ranges using this model at the end of the document.
